# Offline Example For React Native Example Using Tanstack Query

This is a [Expo.dev](https://expo.dev/) project.

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

Then run the run the app on mobile:

```bash
yarn start
#or
npx expo start
```

For use in mobile device to testing offline I recommended using an android device an --localhost option in expo start command to connect device and laptop in local network. In this case you can enabled and disebaled wif connection to testing in physical devices.

This project use [pocketbase](https://pocketbase.io/) as backend.
